    As computers have evolved, many different computer programming languages created for various types 
    of development. Although we do have several dozen languages listed on our site, there are hundreds that we don't have listed. 
    To get an idea of the different programming languages, you can visit The Hello World Collection, 
    which gives a demo of how to write "Hello World" in over 591 different programming languages
andAccording to Wikipedia, there are about 700 programming languages, including esoteric coding languages. Other sources 
that only list notable languages still count up to an impressive 245 languages. Another list called HOPL, that claims to 
include every programming language to ever exist, puts the total number of programming languages at 8,945. 
Some even estimate a total of up to 25,000.
